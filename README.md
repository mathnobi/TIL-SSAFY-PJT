# TIL-SSAFY-PJT

This repository documents my daily learnings from the SSAFY project in a Today I Learned (TIL) format. Each entry includes:

- **What I did today:** Summary of daily activities and tasks.
- **Problems I encountered:** Challenges and obstacles faced during the day.
- **New things I learned:** Fresh concepts, tools, or insights acquired.
- **Things I still donâ€™t fully understand:** Areas needing further exploration or clarification.
- **Areas I feel lacking in:** Skills or knowledge requiring improvement.
- **Things I did well:** Accomplishments and successful endeavors.

By consistently updating this TIL log, I aim to track my growth, address challenges, and celebrate progress throughout the SSAFY journey.
